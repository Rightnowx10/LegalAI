Order

     The petitioner has been arrested in connection with FIR

No.173/2022 of Police Station Sangaria, District Hanumangarh for

the offence punishable underSections 341,323,342,327/34IPC.

He has preferred this bail application under Section 439 Cr.P.C.

Counsel for the petitioner submits that co-accused has

already been released on bail by this Court and the case of the

present accused-petitioner is similar to that of the co-accused. The

accused-petitioner is in judicial custody and the trial of the case

will take sufficient long time to be concluded. Therefore, the

benefit of bail should be granted to the accused-petitioner.
