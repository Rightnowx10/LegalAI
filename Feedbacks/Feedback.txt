if i have asked any question, i need the reasoning as well with it!

so when we found a particular text describing the answer , it was contradicting the answer provided by the assistant, how can it be possible if the text does contain it? 

in another case , the conclusion was given clearly yet the chat answered it wrong, i am doubting that either the whole judgement is not yet processed or scraped properly!

the chat do understand the meaning but it doesnt refer it well to the context or the question provided like example it knew what granting bail means yet it didnt answer that if the appellant was granted bail or not? that meant was the appellant released or not?

i think that the href tags in between the text is not fetched completely because its not in the related text paragraph

one of the problems that is , case briefs, if one can generate a case brief with complete and concise details, it would be helpful and profitable as well.
the text length or the number of pages of a case brief should 1 or 2 pages max.
the language should be simple yet professional, easy to understand yet legal language should be used.

template of the case brief.

facts
issues (court kin cheezo se deal krne wala h , the questions the court will answer?)
what was the point of law involved?
analysis (how does the court dealt with the questions, what were the reasoning along with precedents.)
conclusion (what did the court held ultimately and the reasoning of the conclusion as to how the court reached it?)

this is provided in the judgement!

final feedback that was given was , the answers should be apt, factually correct(it does provide the answers from the text and doesnt hallucinate but it doesnt understand the legality) and in depth with all the information required?
