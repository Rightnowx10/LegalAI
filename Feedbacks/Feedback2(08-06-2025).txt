We need to work on the search as well, so that even if the basic keyword is provided either the student can select the link or it does take the best option available.

Facts are the reason one is approaching the court? What has happened in the lower courts as well that this case reached to an upper court or what were the actual reasons to have a case about? because when we asked what is this case about , it started showing the reasoning instead of providing the facts.

Lets build another scraper which would actually scrap the whole text present in the judgement on the site and then we can use that scraper for our project!
